								<p>Both GopherCard and our participating Merchants may offer GopherCard’s members with the opportunity to send targeted free Gift Cards ("Promotional Gift Cards") to be used for products and services at select GopherCard stores and on their websites. Both GopherCard and our partner GopherCard can choose our target groups based on gender, location, age, etc. and may at their sole discretion issue a limited amount of free Gift Cards to be sent to the respective target group. Promotional Gift Cards expire based on the Merchant instructions.</p>
								<p>GopherCard Users can also choose a participating Merchant and purchase a Gift Card to be delivered electronically to a friend at predetermined values. Users friends are defined by friends available through the user’s email, Facebook account and other methods. By placing an order for a given Gift Card, you agree to purchase the Gift Card you have selected on the Merchant terms, restrictions and conditions associated with the Gift Card. Once you’ve placed your order, you will receive a confirmation of the purchase and your credit card, PayPal or other account will be charged for the amount of any paid portion of the Gift Card value. Once the purchase is confirmed the Gift Card will be sent to the selected friend using GopherCard’s Site and associated platforms at the direction of the Organizer. You are required to register an account with GopherCard in order to purchase or receive any Gift Card. An account is required to ensure the authenticity of your transaction and also to collect your payment information and provide you with easy access to your friends list or contacts as applicable, view your past purchases, and modify your personal preferences.</p>
								<p>Unless otherwise stated by the applicable Merchant, the Gift Card is not redeemable for cash (except in regions where this is required by law). The expiration date for a Gift Card (if any) is as printed or displayed on the Gift Card. If the expiration of the Gift Card as of the date printed on the Gift Card is prohibited under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Merchant is located, then the Gift Card shall expire according to the applicable law. The Merchant is obligated to honor the Gift Card in compliance with law.</p>
								<p>Unless otherwise stated at the time a Gift Card is purchased, the Gift Card price does not include sales taxes, value added taxes or any other taxes which may be charged to you separately by the Merchant at the time you redeem the Gift Card.</p>
								<p>GopherCard is not the issuer of the Merchant Gift Cards. They are issued by the Applicable Merchant and as such the Merchant shall be fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Merchant or its products and services, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed or partially redeemed Gift Cards. By purchasing a Gift Card from GopherCard, a User acquires the right to redeem a Gift Card issued by the participating Merchant and to use the Gift Card subject to the GopherCard terms and conditions and the Terms of this Agreement. Whether the User chooses to redeem the Gift Card prior to its expiration date (If any) is within the user’s sole control and at the user’s sole discretion.</p>

If you have lost or misplaced your Gift Card and the balance has not been spent or changed from the original amount, please call us toll free at 315-640-4438, and we will email you a replacement provided we can confirm the balance is unused. If your Gift Card order is incorrect, you must notify GopherCard within 30 days and provided the balance on the Gift Card has not been spent and has not changed from the original amount, we will make our best reasonable efforts to correct the error. If GopherCard is not notified of any error within 30 days of the date of electronic transmission of the Gift Card, the Gift Card will be deemed to be satisfactory. Some Gift Cards may not be redeemable outside the US. It is your responsibility to confirm if a Merchant’s card can be redeemed internationally.

								<li>Except for small claims disputes in which you or GopherCard seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or GopherCard seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and GopherCard waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Services will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in New York in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (<strong>"Rules"</strong>) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (<strong>"JAMS"</strong>), which are available on the JAMS website and hereby incorporated by reference.

As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and GopherCard agree that for any arbitration you initiate, the party filing the claim will pay the filing fee and the parties will split the remaining JAMS fees and costs. You and GopherCard agree that the state or federal courts of the State of New York and the United States sitting in New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</li>
