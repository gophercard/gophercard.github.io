								<p>GopherCard provides consumers with opportunities to purchase Gift Cards to be used at third-party Merchants.</p>
								<p>Both GopherCard and our participating Merchants may offer GopherCardâ€™s members with the opportunity to send targeted free Gift Cards ("Promotional Gift Cards") to be used for products and services at select GopherCard stores and on their websites. Both GopherCard and our partner GopherCard can choose our target groups based on gender, location, age, etc. and may at their sole discretion issue a limited amount of free Gift Cards to be sent to the respective target group. Promotional Gift Cards expire based on the Merchant instructions.</p>
								<p>GopherCard Users can also choose a participating Merchant and purchase a Gift Card to be delivered electronically to a friend at predetermined values. Users friends are defined by friends available through the userâ€™s email, Facebook account and other methods. By placing an order for a given Gift Card, you agree to purchase the Gift Card you have selected on the Merchant terms, restrictions and conditions associated with the Gift Card. Once youâ€™ve placed your order, you will receive a confirmation of the purchase and your credit card, PayPal or other account will be charged for the amount of any paid portion of the Gift Card value. Once the purchase is confirmed the Gift Card will be sent to the selected friend using GopherCardâ€™s Site and associated platforms at the direction of the Organizer. You are required to register an account with GopherCard in order to purchase or receive any Gift Card. An account is required to ensure the authenticity of your transaction and also to collect your payment information and provide you with easy access to your friends list or contacts as applicable, view your past purchases, and modify your personal preferences.</p>
								<p>Unless otherwise stated by the applicable Merchant, the Gift Card is not redeemable for cash (except in regions where this is required by law). The expiration date for a Gift Card (if any) is as printed or displayed on the Gift Card. If the expiration of the Gift Card as of the date printed on the Gift Card is prohibited under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Merchant is located, then the Gift Card shall expire according to the applicable law. The Merchant is obligated to honor the Gift Card in compliance with law.</p>
								<p>Unless otherwise stated at the time a Gift Card is purchased, the Gift Card price does not include sales taxes, value added taxes or any other taxes which may be charged to you separately by the Merchant at the time you redeem the Gift Card.</p>
								<p>GopherCard is not the issuer of the Merchant Gift Cards. They are issued by the Applicable Merchant and as such the Merchant shall be fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Merchant or its products and services, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed or partially redeemed Gift Cards. By purchasing a Gift Card from GopherCard, a User acquires the right to redeem a Gift Card issued by the participating Merchant and to use the Gift Card subject to the GopherCard terms and conditions and the Terms of this Agreement. Whether the User chooses to redeem the Gift Card prior to its expiration date (If any) is within the userâ€™s sole control and at the userâ€™s sole discretion.</p>
								<p>All risk of loss and title for the Gift Card will pass to the Purchaser, Organizer or Recipient (as applicable) upon electronic transmission to such individual. GopherCard is not responsible if a Gift Card is lost, stolen, destroyed, or used without permission. GopherCard is not responsible if any Gift Card is rendered unsuitable for redemption through no fault of GopherCard. If you have lost or misplaced your Gift Card and the balance has not been spent or changed from the original amount, please call us toll free at 315-640-4438, and we will email you a replacement provided we can confirm the balance is unused. If your Gift Card order is incorrect, you must notify GopherCard within 30 days and provided the balance on the Gift Card has not been spent and has not changed from the original amount, we will make our best reasonable efforts to correct the error. If GopherCard is not notified of any error within 30 days of the date of electronic transmission of the Gift Card, the Gift Card will be deemed to be satisfactory. Some Gift Cards may not be redeemable outside the US. It is your responsibility to confirm if a Merchantâ€™s card can be redeemed internationally. Participating GopherCardâ€™ Gift Cards must be redeemed at the applicable Merchantâ€™s website or physical retail store, subject to the Merchantâ€™s then current terms and conditions.</p>
